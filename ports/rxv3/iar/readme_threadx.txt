                    Microsoft's Azure RTOS ThreadX for Renesas RXv3

                                Using the IAR Tools

3.  System Initialization

The system entry point using the IAR tools is at the label __iar_program_start. 

The vector area is setup in the file tx_initialize_low_level.s. This file is also 
responsible for setting up various system data structures, interrupt vectors, and 
the periodic timer interrupt. This file is also an ideal place add hardware 
initialization code.

The ThreadX demonstration for the RXv3 utilizes CMT0 as a periodic timer interrupt 
source. The CMT0 interrupt is typically setup for 10ms periodic interrupts and the 
interrupt priority level is set to level 7. You may change any of the timer 
parameters as needed.

In addition, _tx_initialize_low_level determines the first available address for use 
by the application, which is supplied as the sole input parameter to your application 
definition function, tx_application_define. The first available memory is determined 
by the location of the FREEMEM section so it should be placed AFTER all other RAM 
sections in your linker control file.


4.  Context Switch, Register Usage and Stack Frames

The RXv3 port for ThreadX uses the first software interrupt, SWINT, i.e., interrupt #17,
to perform context switch. This ISR is thus reserved when using ThreadX and the SWINT
should not be manipulated in any way by the application. The port will setup the 
interrupt within _tx_initialize_low_level and the compiler will automatically install
the necessary interrupt vector. As such no additional initialization is necessary by the
application.

The following defines the saved context stack frame used by the ThreadX port. The
state of the CPU registers at the time of a context switch is saved on the running 
thread's stack The top of the suspended thread's stack is pointed to by 
tx_thread_stack_ptr in the associated thread control block TX_THREAD.

Note: By default IAR does not save the state of the accumulator registers ACC0 and ACC1
when entering an ISR. This means that if the ISR uses any of the DSP instructions the
content of those registers could be corrupted. Saving and restoring of the acummulators
can be enabled by adding the --save_acc command line option.
     

5. Double Precision FPU Instructions Support

The RXv3 architecture supports an optional set of double precision instructions which 
makes use of a new set of registers that must be saved and restored during context 
switches. This feature can be accessed by setting the size of double to 64 bit in the
compiler options. To reduce the overhead of saving and restoring the FPU registers 
for all threads the RXv3 port allows each thread to enable and disable saving and 
restoring the DFPU registers. By default the feature is disabled for new threads. 
To enable the feature tx_thread_fpu_enable() must be called within the context of every 
thread that will perform FPU operation. The saving and restoring of DFPU registers can
be disabled again by calling tx_thread_fpu_disable(). This can be useful if a thread 
only makes occasional use of the FPU.


6.  Improving Performance

The distribution version of ThreadX is built without any compiler optimizations.  This 
makes it easy to debug because you can trace or set breakpoints inside of ThreadX itself.  
Of course, this costs some performance. To make ThreadX run faster, you can change the 
ThreadX Library project to disable debug information and enable the desired optimizations.  

In addition, you can eliminate the ThreadX basic API error checking by compiling your 
application code with the symbol TX_DISABLE_ERROR_CHECKING defined before tx_api.h 
is included. 


7. Timer Processing

Timer processign is performed by calling __tx_timer_interrupt(). This should usually be done
from within the callback of a periodic timer with a period of 100Hz. In the sample projects
a Renesas Fit CMT periodic timer module (rx_cmt) is used as the timer source.


8.  Interrupt Handling

Interrupt handling is unaffected by the ThreadX port as such user interrupts can be 
written according to the toolchain's documentation. It is recommended not to use interrupt
priority 15 as this is the priority of the context switch interrupt. However using interrupt
priority 15 won't cause any negative side effectd but doing so may may slightly reduce 
performance. Please refer to the toolchain documentation for additional details on how to
define interupt service routines.


9. Execution Profiling

The RX port adds support for the Execution Profiling Kit (EPK). The EPK consists 
of the files tx_execution_profile.c and tx_execution_profile.h. See the documentation 
of the EPK for generic usage details.

To add the EPK to your RXv3 release make the following modifications:

* Enable the following define for both the Threadx library and the application
TX_EXECUTION_PROFILE_ENABLE

* Setup CMT1 as a free running 16 bit timer.

* In tx_execution_profile.h, change following around line 52:

#ifdef TX_EXECUTION_64BIT_TIME
typedef unsigned long long              EXECUTION_TIME;
#define TX_EXECUTION_MAX_TIME_SOURCE    0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
#else
typedef unsigned long                   EXECUTION_TIME;
#define TX_EXECUTION_MAX_TIME_SOURCE    0xFFFF
#endif
                                        
/* Define basic constants for the execution profile kit.  */

#define TX_EXECUTION_TIME_SOURCE         (EXECUTION_TIME)  *((USHORT *) 0x8800A)

Rebuild the Threadx library and the application.
Refer to the EPK documentation how to interpret the results.
