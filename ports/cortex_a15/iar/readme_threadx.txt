                       Microsoft's Azure RTOS ThreadX for Cortex-A15 

                                 Thumb & 32-bit Mode

                                 Using the IAR Tools

1.  Building the ThreadX run-time Library

Building the ThreadX library is easy. First, open the Azure RTOS workspace
azure_rtos.eww. Next, make the TX project the "active project" in the 
IAR Embedded Workbench and select the "Make" button. You should observe 
assembly and compilation of a series of ThreadX source files. This 
results in the ThreadX run-time library file tx.a, which is needed by 
the application.


2.  Demonstration System

The ThreadX demonstration is designed to execute under the IAR
Windows-based Cortex-A15 simulator.

Building the demonstration is easy; simply make the sample_threadx.ewp project
the "active project" in the IAR Embedded Workbench and select the 
"Make" button.

You should observe the compilation of sample_threadx.c (which is the demonstration 
application) and linking with tx.a. The resulting file sample_threadx.out is a
binary file that can be downloaded and executed on IAR's Cortex-A15 simulator.


3.  System Initialization

The entry point in ThreadX for the Cortex-A15 using IAR tools is at label 
?cstartup. This is defined within the IAR compiler's startup code. In 
addition, this is where all static and global preset C variable 
initialization processing takes place.

The ThreadX tx_initialize_low_level.s file is responsible for setting up 
various system data structures, and a periodic timer interrupt source. 
By default, the vector area is defined at the top of cstartup.s, which is
a slightly modified from the base IAR file. 

The _tx_initialize_low_level function inside of tx_initialize_low_level.s
also determines the first available address for use by the application, which 
is supplied as the sole input parameter to your application definition function, 
tx_application_define. To accomplish this, a section is created in 
tx_initialize_low_level.s called FREE_MEM, which must be located after all 
other RAM sections in memory.


4.  Register Usage and Stack Frames

The IAR ARM compiler assumes that registers r0-r3 (a1-a4) and r12 (ip) are 
scratch registers for each function. All other registers used by a C function 
must be preserved by the function. ThreadX takes advantage of this in 
situations where a context switch happens as a result of making a ThreadX 
service call (which is itself a C function). In such cases, the saved 
context of a thread is only the non-scratch registers.

The following defines the saved context stack frames for context switches
that occur as a result of interrupt handling or from thread-level API calls.
All suspended threads have one of these two types of stack frames. The top
of the suspended thread's stack is pointed to by tx_thread_stack_ptr in the 
associated thread control block TX_THREAD.

5.  Conditional Compilation Switches

The following are conditional compilation options for building the ThreadX library
and application:


    TX_ENABLE_FIQ_SUPPORT                       This assembler/compiler define enables 
                                                FIQ interrupt handling support in the
                                                ThreadX assembly files. If used,
                                                it should be used on all assembly
                                                files and the generic C source of
                                                ThreadX should be compiled with 
                                                TX_ENABLE_FIQ_SUPPORT defined as well.

    TX_ENABLE_IRQ_NESTING                       This assembler define enables IRQ
                                                nested support. If IRQ nested 
                                                interrupt support is needed, this
                                                define should be applied to 
                                                tx_initialize_low_level.s.

    TX_ENABLE_FIQ_NESTING                       This assembler define enables FIQ
                                                nested support. If FIQ nested 
                                                interrupt support is needed, this
                                                define should be applied to 
                                                tx_initialize_low_level.s. In addition,
                                                IRQ nesting should also be enabled.

    TX_DISABLE_ERROR_CHECKING                   If defined before tx_api.h is included,
                                                this define causes basic ThreadX error
                                                checking to be disabled. Please see
                                                Chapter 2 in the "ThreadX User Guide" 
                                                for more details.

    TX_MAX_PRIORITIES                           Defines the priority levels for ThreadX. 
                                                Legal values range from 32 through 
                                                1024 (inclusive) and MUST be evenly divisible 
                                                by 32. Increasing the number of priority levels 
                                                supported increases the RAM usage by 128 bytes 
                                                for every group of 32 priorities. However, there 
                                                is only a negligible effect on performance. By 
                                                default, this value is set to 32 priority levels.

    TX_MINIMUM_STACK                            Defines the minimum stack size (in bytes). It is 
                                                used for error checking when threads are created. 
                                                The default value is port-specific and is found 
                                                in tx_port.h.

    TX_TIMER_THREAD_STACK_SIZE                  Defines the stack size (in bytes) of the internal 
                                                ThreadX timer thread. This thread processes all 
                                                thread sleep requests as well as all service call 
                                                timeouts. In addition, all application timer callback 
                                                routines are invoked from this context. The default 
                                                value is port-specific and is found in tx_port.h.

    TX_TIMER_THREAD_PRIORITY                    Defines the priority of the internal ThreadX timer 
                                                thread. The default value is priority 0 - the highest 
                                                priority in ThreadX. The default value is defined 
                                                in tx_port.h.

    TX_TIMER_PROCESS_IN_ISR                     Defined, this option eliminates the internal system 
                                                timer thread for ThreadX. This results in improved 
                                                performance on timer events and smaller RAM requirements 
                                                because the timer stack and control block are no 
                                                longer needed. However, using this option moves all 
                                                the timer expiration processing to the timer ISR level. 
                                                By default, this option is not defined.

    TX_REACTIVATE_INLINE                        Defined, this option performs reactivation of ThreadX 
                                                timers in-line instead of using a function call. This 
                                                improves performance but slightly increases code size. 
                                                By default, this option is not defined.

    TX_DISABLE_STACK_FILLING                    Defined, placing the 0xEF value in each byte of each 
                                                thread's stack is disabled. By default, this option is 
                                                not defined.

    TX_ENABLE_STACK_CHECKING                    Defined, this option enables ThreadX run-time stack checking, 
                                                which includes analysis of how much stack has been used and 
                                                examination of data pattern "fences" before and after the 
                                                stack area. If a stack error is detected, the registered 
                                                application stack error handler is called. This option does 
                                                result in slightly increased overhead and code size. Please 
                                                review the tx_thread_stack_error_notify API for more information. 
                                                By default, this option is not defined.

    TX_DISABLE_PREEMPTION_THRESHOLD             Defined, this option disables the preemption-threshold feature 
                                                and slightly reduces code size and improves performance. Of course, 
                                                the preemption-threshold capabilities are no longer available. 
                                                By default, this option is not defined.

    TX_DISABLE_REDUNDANT_CLEARING               Defined, this option removes the logic for initializing ThreadX 
                                                global C data structures to zero. This should only be used if 
                                                the compiler's initialization code sets all un-initialized 
                                                C global data to zero. Using this option slightly reduces 
                                                code size and improves performance during initialization. 
                                                By default, this option is not defined.

    TX_DISABLE_NOTIFY_CALLBACKS                 Defined, this option disables the notify callbacks for various 
                                                ThreadX objects. Using this option slightly reduces code size 
                                                and improves performance.

    TX_BLOCK_POOL_ENABLE_PERFORMANCE_INFO       Defined, this option enables the gathering of performance 
                                                information on block pools. By default, this option is 
                                                not defined.

    TX_BYTE_POOL_ENABLE_PERFORMANCE_INFO        Defined, this option enables the gathering of performance 
                                                information on byte pools. By default, this option is 
                                                not defined.

    TX_EVENT_FLAGS_ENABLE_PERFORMANCE_INFO      Defined, this option enables the gathering of performance 
                                                information on event flags groups. By default, this option 
                                                is not defined.

    TX_MUTEX_ENABLE_PERFORMANCE_INFO            Defined, this option enables the gathering of performance 
                                                information on mutexes. By default, this option is 
                                                not defined.

    TX_QUEUE_ENABLE_PERFORMANCE_INFO            Defined, this option enables the gathering of performance 
                                                information on queues. By default, this option is 
                                                not defined.

    TX_SEMAPHORE_ENABLE_PERFORMANCE_INFO        Defined, this option enables the gathering of performance 
                                                information on semaphores. By default, this option is 
                                                not defined.

    TX_THREAD_ENABLE_PERFORMANCE_INFO           Defined, this option enables the gathering of performance 
                                                information on threads. By default, this option is 
                                                not defined.

    TX_TIMER_ENABLE_PERFORMANCE_INFO            Defined, this option enables the gathering of performance 
                                                information on timers. By default, this option is 
                                                not defined.

    TX_ENABLE_EVENT_TRACE                       Defined, this option enables the internal ThreadX trace
                                                feature. The trace buffer is supplied at a later time
                                                via an application call to tx_trace_enable.

    TX_TRACE_TIME_SOURCE                        This defines the time-stamp source for event tracing. 
                                                This define is only pertinent if the ThreadX library is 
                                                built with TX_ENABLE_EVENT_TRACE defined.

    TX_TRACE_TIME_MASK                          This defines the number of valid bits in the event trace 
                                                time-stamp source defined previously. If the time-stamp 
                                                source is 16-bits, this value should be 0xFFFF. Alternatively, 
                                                if the time-stamp source is 32-bits, this value should be 
                                                0xFFFFFFFF. This define is only pertinent if the ThreadX 
                                                library is built with TX_ENABLE_EVENT_TRACE defined.

    TX_THUMB                                    Defined, this option enables the BX LR calling return sequence
                                                in assembly files, to ensure correct operation on systems that
                                                use both ARM and Thumb mode. By default, this option is
                                                not defined





6.  Improving Performance

The distribution version of ThreadX is built without any compiler 
optimizations. This makes it easy to debug because you can trace or set 
breakpoints inside of ThreadX itself. Of course, this costs some 
performance. To make it run faster, you can change the ThreadX library
project to enable various compiler optimizations. 

In addition, you can eliminate the ThreadX basic API error checking by 
compiling your application code with the symbol TX_DISABLE_ERROR_CHECKING 
defined. 


7.  Interrupt Handling

ThreadX provides complete and high-performance interrupt handling for Cortex-A15
targets. There are a certain set of requirements that are defined in the 
following sub-sections:


7.1  Vector Area

The Cortex-A15 vectors start at address zero. The demonstration system startup
cstartup.s file contains the vectors and is loaded at address zero. 
On actual hardware platforms, this area might have to be copied to address 0. 


7.2  IRQ ISRs

ThreadX fully manages standard and vectored IRQ interrupts. ThreadX also supports nested
IRQ interrupts. The following sub-sections define the IRQ capabilities.


7.2.1 Standard IRQ ISRs

The standard ARM IRQ mechanism has a single interrupt vector at address 0x18. This IRQ 
interrupt is managed by the __tx_irq_handler code in tx_initialize_low_level. The following 
is the default IRQ handler defined in tx_initialize_low_level.s:

    PUBLIC  __tx_irq_handler
    PUBLIC  __tx_irq_processing_return      
__tx_irq_handler
;
;    /* Jump to context save to save system context.  */
    B       _tx_thread_context_save
__tx_irq_processing_return
;
;    /* At this point execution is still in the IRQ mode. The CPSR, point of
;       interrupt, and all C scratch registers are available for use. Note 
;       that IRQ interrupts are still disabled upon return from the context
;       save function.  */
;
;    /* Application ISR dispatch call goes here!  */
;
;    /* Jump to context restore to restore system context.  */
    B       _tx_thread_context_restore


7.2.2 Vectored IRQ ISRs

The vectored ARM IRQ mechanism has multiple interrupt vectors at addresses specified
by the particular implementation. The following is an example IRQ handler defined in 
tx_initialize_low_level.s:


    RSEG    .text:CODE:NOROOT(2)
    PUBLIC  __tx_example_vectored_irq_handler
__tx_example_vectored_irq_handler
;
;    /* Jump to context save to save system context.  */
    STMDB   sp!, {r0-r3}                    ; Save some scratch registers
    MRS     r0, SPSR                        ; Pickup saved SPSR
    SUB     lr, lr, #4                      ; Adjust point of interrupt 
    STMDB   sp!, {r0, r10, r12, lr}         ; Store other registers
    BL      _tx_thread_vectored_context_save
;
;    /* At this point execution is still in the IRQ mode. The CPSR, point of
;       interrupt, and all C scratch registers are available for use. Note 
;       that IRQ interrupts are still disabled upon return from the context
;       save function.  */
;
;    /* Application ISR dispatch call goes here!  */
;
;    /* Jump to context restore to restore system context.  */
    B       _tx_thread_context_restore


7.2.3  Nested IRQ Support

By default, nested IRQ interrupt support is not enabled. To enable nested
IRQ support, the entire library should be built with TX_ENABLE_IRQ_NESTING
defined. With this defined, two new IRQ interrupt management services are
available, namely _tx_thread_irq_nesting_start and _tx_thread_irq_nesting_end.
These function should be called between the IRQ context save and restore
calls. 

Execution between the calls to _tx_thread_irq_nesting_start and 
_tx_thread_irq_nesting_end is enabled for IRQ nesting. This is achieved 
by switching from IRQ mode to SYS mode and enabling IRQ interrupts.
The SYS mode stack is used during the SYS mode operation, which was 
setup in tx_initialize_low_level.s. When nested IRQ interrupts are no 
longer required, calling the _tx_thread_irq_nesting_end service disables 
nesting by disabling IRQ interrupts and switching back to IRQ mode in 
preparation for the IRQ context restore service.

The following is an example of enabling IRQ nested interrupts in a standard 
IRQ handler:

    RSEG    .text:CODE:NOROOT(2)
    PUBLIC  __tx_irq_handler
    RSEG    .text:CODE:NOROOT(2)
    PUBLIC  __tx_irq_processing_return      
__tx_irq_handler
;
;    /* Jump to context save to save system context.  */
    B       _tx_thread_context_save
__tx_irq_processing_return
;
;    /* At this point execution is still in the IRQ mode. The CPSR, point of
;       interrupt, and all C scratch registers are available for use. Note 
;       that IRQ interrupts are still disabled upon return from the context
;       save function.  */
;
;    /* Interrupt nesting is allowed after calling _tx_thread_irq_nesting_start 
;       from IRQ mode with interrupts disabled. This routine switches to the
;       system mode and returns with IRQ interrupts enabled. 
;       
;       NOTE:  It is very important to ensure all IRQ interrupts are cleared 
;       prior to enabling nested IRQ interrupts. */
;
    BL      _tx_thread_irq_nesting_start

;    /* Application ISR dispatch call goes here!  */
;
;    /* If interrupt nesting was started earlier, the end of interrupt nesting
;       service must be called before returning to _tx_thread_context_restore. 
;       This routine returns in processing in IRQ mode with interrupts disabled.  */
;
    BL      _tx_thread_irq_nesting_end
;
;    /* Jump to context restore to restore system context.  */
    B       _tx_thread_context_restore


7.3  FIQ Interrupts

By default, Cortex-A15 FIQ interrupts are left alone by ThreadX. Of course, this 
means that the application is fully responsible for enabling the FIQ interrupt 
and saving/restoring any registers used in the FIQ ISR processing. To globally 
enable FIQ interrupts, the application should enable FIQ interrupts at the 
beginning of each thread or before any threads are created in tx_application_define. 
In addition, the application must ensure that no ThreadX service calls are made 
from default FIQ ISRs, which is located in tx_initialize_low_level.s.


7.3.1  Managed FIQ Interrupts

Full ThreadX management of FIQ interrupts is provided if the ThreadX sources
are built with the TX_ENABLE_FIQ_SUPPORT defined. If the library is built
this way, the FIQ interrupt handlers are very similar to the IRQ interrupt
handlers defined previously. The following is default FIQ handler 
defined in tx_initialize_low_level.s:


    RSEG    .text:CODE:NOROOT(2)
    PUBLIC  __tx_fiq_handler
    RSEG    .text:CODE:NOROOT(2)
    PUBLIC  __tx_fiq_processing_return
__tx_fiq_handler
;
;    /* Jump to fiq context save to save system context.  */
    B       _tx_thread_fiq_context_save
__tx_fiq_processing_return:
;
;    /* At this point execution is still in the FIQ mode. The CPSR, point of
;       interrupt, and all C scratch registers are available for use.  */
;
;    /* Application FIQ dispatch call goes here!  */
;
;    /* Jump to fiq context restore to restore system context.  */
    B       _tx_thread_fiq_context_restore



7.3.1.1 Nested FIQ Support

By default, nested FIQ interrupt support is not enabled. To enable nested
FIQ support, the entire library should be built with TX_ENABLE_FIQ_NESTING
defined. With this defined, two new FIQ interrupt management services are
available, namely _tx_thread_fiq_nesting_start and _tx_thread_fiq_nesting_end.
These function should be called between the FIQ context save and restore
calls. 

Execution between the calls to _tx_thread_fiq_nesting_start and 
_tx_thread_fiq_nesting_end is enabled for FIQ nesting. This is achieved 
by switching from FIQ mode to SYS mode and enabling FIQ interrupts.
The SYS mode stack is used during the SYS mode operation, which was 
setup in tx_initialize_low_level.s. When nested FIQ interrupts are no 
longer required, calling the _tx_thread_fiq_nesting_end service disables 
nesting by disabling FIQ interrupts and switching back to FIQ mode in 
preparation for the FIQ context restore service.

The following is an example of enabling FIQ nested interrupts in the 
typical FIQ handler:


    RSEG    .text:CODE:NOROOT(2)
    PUBLIC  __tx_fiq_handler
    RSEG    .text:CODE:NOROOT(2)
    PUBLIC  __tx_fiq_processing_return
__tx_fiq_handler
;
;    /* Jump to fiq context save to save system context.  */
    B       _tx_thread_fiq_context_save
__tx_fiq_processing_return:
;
;    /* At this point execution is still in the FIQ mode. The CPSR, point of
;       interrupt, and all C scratch registers are available for use.  */
;
;    /* Enable nested FIQ interrupts. NOTE:  Since this service returns
;       with FIQ interrupts enabled, all FIQ interrupt sources must be 
;       cleared prior to calling this service.  */
    BL      _tx_thread_fiq_nesting_start
;
;    /* Application FIQ dispatch call goes here!  */
;
;    /* Disable nested FIQ interrupts. The mode is switched back to
;       FIQ mode and FIQ interrupts are disable upon return.  */
    BL      _tx_thread_fiq_nesting_end
;
;    /* Jump to fiq context restore to restore system context.  */
    B       _tx_thread_fiq_context_restore


8.  ThreadX Timer Interrupt

ThreadX requires a periodic interrupt source to manage all time-slicing, 
thread sleeps, timeouts, and application timers. Without such a timer 
interrupt source, these services are not functional. However, all other
ThreadX services are operational without a periodic timer source.

To add the timer interrupt processing, simply make a call to _tx_timer_interrupt 
in the IRQ processing.


9.  Thumb/Cortex-A15 Mixed Mode

By default, ThreadX is setup for running in Cortex-A15 32-bit mode. This is 
also true for the demonstration system. It is possible to build any 
ThreadX file and/or the application in Thumb mode. The only exception
to this is the file tx_thread_shell_entry.c. This file must always be 
built in 32-bit mode. In addition, if any Thumb code is used the entire 
ThreadX assembly source should be built with TX_THUMB defined.


10.  IAR Thread-safe Library Support

Thread-safe support for the IAR tools is easily enabled by building the ThreadX library
and the application with TX_ENABLE_IAR_LIBRARY_SUPPORT. Also, the linker control file
should have the following line added (if not already in place):

initialize by copy with packing = none { section __DLIB_PERTHREAD }; // Required in a multi-threaded application

The project options "General Options -> Library Configuration" should also have the 
"Enable thread support in library" box selected.


11. VFP Support

By default, VFP support is disabled for each thread. If saving the context of the VFP registers
is needed, the following API call must be made from the context of the application thread - before 
the VFP usage:

void    tx_thread_vfp_enable(void);

After this API is called in the application, VFP registers will be saved/restored for this thread if it
is preempted via an interrupt. All other suspension of the this thread will not require the VFP registers
to be saved/restored.

To disable VFP register context saving, simply call the following API:

void    tx_thread_vfp_disable(void);
